## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Code Book
This codebook describes the process, code, and output file associated with the Getting and Leaning Data Course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome).  
## The Process:
- The support documents were downloaded by my local machine from the following website: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
-  These files were unzipped into a root folder containing:"UCI HAR Dataset".  This root folder is considered the root for the script as well. 
-  An R script file titled "run_Analysis.R" was created in the root folder
